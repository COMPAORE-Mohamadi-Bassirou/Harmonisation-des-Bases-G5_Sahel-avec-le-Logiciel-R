//Harmonization of G5 Sahel Data

Our Objectives were to harmonize all the variables of the datas and also their labels in order to make using the datas easily
We have many datas which are collected in different countries . All the data have some common variables but according to the survey,
there is a different because the Coutries don't have the same reality. And also it's not the same Persons who are making all these survey. So that,there are some mistakes 
in the labels parts and also the way they planed all the codes of vaiables.
The main objectives in this project are to make sure that the common variables are the same in all the datas !
